The beauty of this game lies in its simplicity as you only need to download the zip file and its two libraries to enjoy the destruction of luxury items.

```

### Deployment

Give a step-by-step rundown of how to **use** your project. Including screenshots in this section can be highly effective for highlighting specific features of your project.

Github MAKEFILE images connected with path to github rep images? Oh well, basic rundown: Enjoy the AI generated background country music when you first see the start menu. Choose your level (1-3) with the board dimensions (), (),  with an increasing number of gems to crush.
Your goal is to match at least three gems horizontally or vertically to crush the gems. Use your mouse to click on the two gems you want to swap; note swaps can only be made with the gem immediate to its left, right, top, or bottom, else the move is considered invalid. If you don’t like the first candy you chose, click on it again to deselect the initial candy and choose another candy.
Each valid move will reduce your turn’s counter. Watch your score soar, but be sure to complete the objective before your turns = 0, then it’s Game Over! Have fun playing.
