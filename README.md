*Treasure Crush is inspired by the iconic game Candy Crush, where the player has to crush the specified number of gems to win the game. Explore three levels each with different board dimensions as you break through precious gems by matching at least three consecutive gems. Play to crush the number of gems before your turns run out!*

## Usage

This section walks a prospective user through the process of installing and running the project on their local machine. The more detailed and the more accurate, the better. User-friendly instructions will entice prospective users (including judges) to engage more deeply with your project, which could improve your hackathon score.

### Prerequisites

What prerequisites must be installed in order to run your project, and how do you install them?

```
Prerequisite: Be sure to install py_game and py-menu. Be aware that the pip-statement spelling is different from its import statement. 

$> pip install pygame-menu -U

import pygame
import pygame_menu

```

### Installation

Give a step-by-step rundown of how to **install** your project.

State step 1.
```
Provide code samples in this fenced code block.

Etc.

```
The beauty of this game lies in its simplicity! 
You only need to download the zip file and its two libraries to enjoy the destruction of luxury items.

### Deployment

Give a step-by-step rundown of how to **use** your project. Including screenshots in this section can be highly effective for highlighting specific features of your project.

Enjoy the AI generated 8-bit background music when you first see the start menu. Choose your level (1-3) with the board dimensions (), (),  with an increasing number of gems to crush.
Your goal is to match at least three gems horizontally or vertically to crush the gems. Use your mouse to click on the two gems you want to swap; note swaps can only be made with the gem immediate to its left, right, top, or bottom, else the move is considered invalid. If you don’t like the first gem you chose, click on it again to deselect the initial gem and choose another gem .
Each valid move will reduce your turn’s counter. Watch your score soar, but be sure to complete the objective before your turns = 0, then it’s Game Over! Have fun playing.

Step 1.
```
Enjoy the AI generated background 8-bit music when you first see the start menu. 
Choose your level of 1 or 2 and either crush 60 gems within 15 turns on (8x8) board or crush 70 gems within 10 turns on (9x9) board.
```

Step 2.
```
Your goal is to match at least three gems horizontally or vertically to crush the gems. 
Use your mouse to click on the two gems you want to swap; note swaps can only be made with the gem immediate to its left, right, top, or bottom, else the move is considered invalid. 
If you don’t like the first gem you chose, click on it again to deselect the initial gem and choose another gem.
```
Step 3.
```
Each valid move will reduce your turn’s counter. 
Watch your score soar, but be sure to complete the objective before your turns = 0, then it’s Game Over! 
Have fun playing.

### Project Story
## Inspiration
The idea of Treasure Crush game arise from our first group meeting. Although it's our first time working together, we all have high expectations on our project. Since we all love Python and playing games, we decided to make a Python game together. 
## What it does
Treasure Crush is inspired by the iconic game Candy Crush, where the player needs to crush the specified number of gems to win the game. Explore three levels each with different board dimensions as you break through precious gems by matching at least three consecutive gems. Play to crush the number of gems before your turns run out!
## How we built it
The running of the Treasure Crush game requires the Python environment. It uses Python packages including pygame. And the development of the Treasure Crush game are boosted with Github. After we decided what we need to do, all three members of us start coding our part of the project. For example, we need to design the game view, the game logic, the winning criteria, etc. And then all pieces of work are joined together to make the Treasure Crush game. We also spent a lot of time on debugging and tuning the game so to make it better.
## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we met I believe is the game algorithm that controls the gems. Since the game is quite different type of program from some other Python programs that a game has a dynamic view. Every time the user clicked the mouse, we need to update the view. With nested loops sometimes it's hard to fully control the flow of variables.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Finally we have the game running! It runs just as what we expected and we have a lot of fun playing it. It has several levels with increasing difficulty.
## What we learned
Team working is the most important thing during the project.  Now we are all better team workers. Also our python skills are definitely improved. Also our communicating skills and time management skills are practiced during the project.
## What's next for Treasure Crush
We are gonna keep polishing the game so that it becomes a even more better game. We also want to add different gaming rules to it. Further plans including transporting the game to a web environment so it does not rely on Python environment so it can be played anywhere. Even more fun to come!
